ArduBot is home made robot fully printed on the reprap 3D printer. It is based on arduino nano board, servos and ultrasonic sensor. It is easy to print, assemble, small, fun and great intro into electronics and robotics.
ArduBot is fully controlled by IR remote control and it has 3 modes:
- Manual control by IR remote ( forward, backward, right and left)
- Autonomous mode ( ArduBot navigates to avoiding obstacles and choosing the best way.)
- Monitor mode ( ArduBot is monitorng objects in front of the sensor. )


The robot assembling is easy. Follow these instructions:
1) Print all these parts:

	1x Front mount part
	1x Rear mount part
	1x Speaker cube part
	1x Speaker grille part
	1x Battery holder part
	1X Battery pack part
	1x hc-sr04 front part
	1x hc-sr04 back part
	1x small wheel holder part
	1x small wheel holder top part
	1x small wheel part
	2x main wheel part

2) Parts you need to buy:

	1x Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04
	2x Servo motor Futaba S3003
	1x Micro servo motor SG90
	1x Arduino Nano rev. 3
	1x IR receiver TSOP382 or another
	1x PC Speaker
	4x AAA battery

	3) Hack Futaba servos so they can turn 360 degrees
	4) Assembly all parts together
	5) Connect everything with schematic on https://github.com/davidhrbaty/ArduBot
	6) Modify program to your IR remote controll
	7) Upload program to Arduino which you can download from https://github.com/davidhrbaty/ArduBot
	8) Insert batteries into battery pack
	9) Ready to go :-)
